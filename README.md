# Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

A series of notebooks implementing a suite of Deep RL Algorithms.

These are meant to serve as:
* A refresher exercise for myself on Deep RL and Tensorflow (especially TF2)
* A set of reference implementations of some basic RL components that I need for my own RL research. Once these are working well I'm going to try out some new exploration algorithms that I've been developing.

Libraries and tools used:
* All of these are Google Colab Notebooks, so run them: https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb
* All of them are written in Tensorflow (mostly TF2, but some are in TF1)
* Some use the Sonnet library of neural network models, some use Keras
